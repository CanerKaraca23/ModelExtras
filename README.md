ModelExtras is a modification that adds extra functionality to pedestrian, vehicle, and weapon models in **GTA: San Andreas**. This mod enhances customization and introduces new features to improve your gaming experience.  

âš  **Important:** To work correctly, ModelExtras requires model adaptation. Pedestrian, vehicle, and weapon models must be adjusted accordingly. Detailed adaptation instructions are available in the sidebar.  

## Getting Started  

Follow these key guidelines to use ModelExtras effectively:  

### 1. **Model Adaptation is Required**  
ModelExtras **will not work by default**. You must adapt your pedestrian, vehicle, or weapon models for compatibility. See the sidebar for step-by-step adaptation instructions.  

### 2. **Compatible with Other Mods**  
ModelExtras works with models designed for:  
- **EarShot**  (Funtionality included in ModelExtras)
- **PedFunc**  (Funtionality included in ModelExtras)
- **VehFunc**  
- **EnhFunc**  
- **ImVehFt**  (Funtionality included in ModelExtras)
- **AVS** (Funtionality included in ModelExtras)

You can combine these mods for even more customization options.  

### 3. **Node Name Limitations**  
The game limits node names to **23 characters**. Exceeding this may cause crashes, so keep names short.
